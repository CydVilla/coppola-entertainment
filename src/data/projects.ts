    synopsis: `It's spring, 1970, and 11 year-old Patrick, is about to grow up in a hurry and watch his life take shape forever. Patrick's idol, Johnny Spinelli returns from basic training with three days before heading to Viet Nam. Patrick's baseball team, the Redskins, are battling for a championship, while at school he battles with a vindictive nun trying to survive the final days of sixth grade. At home, his relationship with his tough-guy father suffers due to Patrick's poor hitting problems at school and his fear of not living up to his father's expectations on the baseball diamond. Johnny's three days home are cherished. While Johnny helps solve Patrick's hitting problems, Patrick learns about some very important lessons about life. Before Johnny heads off to Viet Nam he asks Patrick to keep an eye on 11 year-old Cheryl Fucci, Patrick's schoolmate, a cute blue-eyed blonde who wears leg braces and whose older brother, Bobby, has recently died in Viet Nam. Bobby was Johnny's best friend and had asked Johnny to watch over his sister. Patrick reluctantly agrees. He is a bit shy about being with Cheryl, and his friend's teasing, causes a strain on their developing relationship.

Things seem to be on cruise control as the Redskins close in on their rivals, the Elks. Patrick is playing well and writes about it to Johnny. Patrick survives his first school dance, he defends Cheryl by punching out a bully, and begins to bond with her. In a must win game Patrick makes a diving catch to win, but injures his arm badly. The doctors tell him his Little League career is over.

When news from Viet Nam comes it is bad. Johnny is killed within a week. It is 11 year-old Cheryl, who has already dealt with her brother's death, who keeps Patrick together. With Johnny's death and the daily problems he faces with his nun at school, Patrick loses faith in God and in himself. When the Elks tie their final game creating a playoff for the championship, Patrick could care less. He leads a classroom revolt and his father is summoned to the school. Patrick listens from down the hall as his father defends his son's actions. On the ride home Patrick realizes the love and support he has always had from his father.

His relationship with Cheryl is strained after she tells him that his team needs him and that if she had the ability to play like everyone else she wouldn't waste it. Patrick braces her for being so frank and she challenges his fears. After some soul searching he decides to play in the game without telling his family. When his father notices the uniform is missing he rushes to the ball field and spots Patrick wearing a black armband. He tells his son he has a lot of class and he can dedicate this game to Johnny. Patrick tells his father "I'm dedicating it to you, dad." The game is an up and down battle with Patrick playing with physical and mental pain before his family and friends. The Redskins triumph and so does Patrick whose life has taken shape forever.`,

In spite of being sharply reminded that it has been 30 years since Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Anthony is reluctant to introduce her to his large Italian-American family.

Yet when Alissa does accompany Anthony home when his grandfather dies, he learns that race is only one of many issues this eccentric family contends with; two of Anthony's cousins are under the mistaken belief that they are wanted by the mob, his uncle talks endlessly about his testicles, and his aunt takes Alissa aside and tells her that the only way to survive in this wacky family is to drink.`,
