# 🎬 Client Animation Updates - Cinema Projector

## What Was Implemented

Based on your idea of using the cinema projector video, I've created a stunning **3-stage animation** that brings your vision to life!

## 🎥 The Animation Sequence

### Stage 1: Cinema Projector (0-2 seconds)
- Your cinema projector video plays in the background
- Creates an authentic film industry atmosphere
- Projector light beam effect

### Stage 2: Projection (2-3.5 seconds)
- A bright white projection screen appears
- "COPPOLA ENTERTAINMENT" is projected onto the screen
- Film reel icon glows above
- Authentic film grain and flicker effects
- Text fades up with dramatic glow

### Stage 3: Screen Vanishes (3.5+ seconds)
- The white screen elegantly fades away
- Projected text transforms into solid logo
- Navigation menu appears
- Clean, professional final state

**Total animation: 4 seconds**

- 🎬 **Film grain texture** - Authentic vintage film look
