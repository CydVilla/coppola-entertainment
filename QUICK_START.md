## Get Up and Running in 3 Steps!

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

### Step 2: Add Your Images (5 minutes)

You need to add images to make the site look complete:

#### Required Movie Posters
Copy your movie poster images into `public/posters/` folder:
- `redskin.jpg`
- `providence.jpg`
- `seaside.jpg`
- `jesus-mary-joey.jpg`
- `angels-dance.jpg`
- `tonys-turf.jpg`
- `johnny-coppola.jpg`
- `doctor-egelman.jpg`

#### Required Photos
Copy these to the `public/` folder:
- `patrick-coppola.jpg` (for Biography page)

**Image Tips:**
- Use JPG format for smaller file sizes
- Movie posters should be portrait (taller than wide)
- Recommended size: 600x900 pixels
- Don't worry if some are missing - placeholders will show

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization (Optional)

Edit these files and search for `#c66302`:

- `src/App.css`

### Want to adjust animation speed?
- Film reel: `src/components/FilmReelHeader.tsx` (line 15)

## ðŸ“¦ Ready for Production?

When ready to deploy your site:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with optimized files ready for your web host.

Then preview it:
```bash
npm run preview
```

Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web hosting service!

## ðŸ†˜ Something Not Working?

### Common Issues:

**Port 5173 already in use?**
- Vite will automatically use next port (5174, 5175, etc)
- Or stop other dev servers and try again

**Images not showing?**
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive!)
- Make sure images are in correct folders
- Hard refresh browser: Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)

**Animations not playing?**
- Clear browser cache
- Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

**White screen / errors?**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Check for red error messages
- Common fix: delete `node_modules` folder and run `npm install` again
