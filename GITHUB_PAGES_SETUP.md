## 🎯 What Happens Behind the Scenes

I've set up automatic deployment using GitHub Actions:

1. **Push to GitHub** → Triggers deployment
2. **Installs dependencies** → Runs `npm ci`
3. **Builds the site** → Runs `npm run build`
4. **Deploys to Pages** → Makes it live

All automatic! 🚀

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If the deployment fails:

1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings
3. Verify source is set to "GitHub Actions"

### If you see 404 errors for images/videos:

Make sure your image files are committed to the repository. The video file is large (44MB) and is already included.
