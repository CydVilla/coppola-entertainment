- TypeScript
- Vite (build tool)
- React Router (navigation)
- Framer Motion (animations)

### 2. Add Your Images

You need to add the movie poster images and photos to the `public` folder:

#### Create the posters folder:
```bash
mkdir -p public/posters
```

#### Required images:

**Movie Posters** (place in `public/posters/`):
- `redskin.jpg` - When I Was A Redskin
- `providence.jpg` - I Make In Providence
- `seaside.jpg` - Seaside Seduction
- `jesus-mary-joey.jpg` - Jesus, Mary and Joey
- `angels-dance.jpg` - Where Angels Dance

- `theater-bg.jpg` - (Optional) Custom theater background

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The website will open at `http://localhost:5173`

You should see:
- âœ… Film reel spinning animation on header
- âœ… Navigation menu appearing after animation
- âœ… Theater curtains opening to reveal featured project

```

This creates an optimized build in the `dist` folder that you can upload to your web host.
